# Arduino Matrix

Some Arduino experiments with the [1.2" Bi-color LED Matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/products/902).

These experiments all need at least the Adafruit [GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) & [LED Backpack](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library) libraries. Maybe more stuff.
